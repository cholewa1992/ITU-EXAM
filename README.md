ITU-EXAM-TEMPLATE
==================

This is an LaTeX template for ITU exams at the IT University of Copenhagen where you need to include code. Everyone is allowed to use and change this template in any way they want. Feel free to fork and commit improvements.

A make file that combines the LaTex document with the ITU frontpage is included. However, it will only work for OSX and linux.
